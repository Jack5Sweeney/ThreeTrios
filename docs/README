The overall purpose of this codebase it to implement a card game, which is based off of
player interactions and different view updates. The project facilitates card-based gameplay where
components interact in harmony to create a playable and fun game. People that try to use this
codebase will need a basic understanding of java as well as being familiar with OOD design
principals. There are 3 interfaces where the classes all implement the interfaces that we created.
There are four enums that are used for the project which are a specific design choice.

An example of a quick setup/initialization would be :
    redPlayer = new PlayerImpl(PlayerColor.RED, new ArrayList<>());
    bluePlayer = new PlayerImpl(PlayerColor.BLUE, new ArrayList<>());
    players = new ArrayList<>(List.of(redPlayer, bluePlayer));
    model = new ModelImpl("board.config", "card.database", players);
and then model.startGame();

This demonstrates the setup of a model and players, and how to start a basic game.

Key Components:

Model (ModelImpl) : Manages the game's logic, handles the state, rules, and structure for cards
and players.

View (ViewImpl) : This renders the view in a way that can be seen through a string version
of the game.

Player (PlayerImpl) : Represents individual players in the game, it has attributes like color
and score.

Key Subcomponents :

Direction and Direction value: These are important enums that determine the direction and
value of each card, which is vital for the model and logic of the game.

CellType: This is an enum which determines if the cell of the board is empty, a card, or a hole.
this is important for the board configuration and how the game can be played.

Card: This class is for the creation of a card. The card has a player, a player name, and the
directions and the values that go with each direction.

PlayerColor: This is a simple enum that helps determine if it is either a red or blue player.
