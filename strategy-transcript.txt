FlipTheMostStrategy strategy transcript in 3x3 grid with no holes and no cards and red player is placing:
[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]]

We chose the corner strategy as the "easiest" strategy to record in this transcript because there is
less logic that goes into the strategy, and this strategy is more of a brute force implementation where
we check every single cell (seen in the transcript above).
