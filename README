The overall purpose of this codebase it to implement a card game, which is based off of
player interactions and different view updates. The project facilitates card-based gameplay where
components interact in harmony to create a playable and fun game. People that try to use this
codebase will need a basic understanding of java as well as being familiar with OOD design
principals. There are 3 interfaces where the classes all implement the interfaces that we created.
There are four enums that are used for the project which are a specific design choice.

An example of a quick setup/initialization would be :
    PlayerImpl redPlayer = new PlayerImpl(PlayerColor.RED, new ArrayList<>());
    PlayerImpl bluePlayer = new PlayerImpl(PlayerColor.BLUE, new ArrayList<>());
    ArrayList<IPlayer> players = new ArrayList<>(List.of(redPlayer, bluePlayer));

    ConfigGame gameConfigurator = new ConfigGame("board.config", "card.database");
    ModelImpl model = new ModelImpl(gameConfigurator.getBoard(), gameConfigurator.getDeck(), players);
    ReadOnlyIModel readOnlyModel = new ModelImpl(gameConfigurator.getBoard(), gameConfigurator.getDeck(), players);

    ControllerGUIImpl controller = new ControllerGUIImpl(readOnlyModel);
    controller.playGame(model);

This demonstrates the setup of a model and players, and how to start a basic game.

Key Components:

Model (model.ModelImpl) : Manages the game's logic, handles the state, rules, and structure for cards
and players.

View (view.TextViewImpl) : This renders the view in a way that can be seen through a string version
of the game.

Player (player.PlayerImpl) : Represents individual players in the game, it has attributes like color
and score.

Key Subcomponents :

card.Direction and card.Direction value: These are important enums that determine the direction and
value of each card, which is vital for the model and logic of the game.

card.CellType: This is an enum which determines if the cell of the board is empty, a card, or a hole.
this is important for the board configuration and how the game can be played.

card.CardImpl: This class is for the creation of a card. The card has a player, a player name, and the
directions and the values that go with each direction.

player.PlayerColor: This is a simple enum that helps determine if it is either a red or blue player.

Class Invariants:
The board availability and board with cards arrays are consistent. For any position (i, j):
If boardAvailability[i][j] == card.CellType. CARD, then boardWithCards[i][j] != null.
If boardAvailability[i][j] != card.CellType. CARD, then boardWithCards[i][j] == null.

In the configBoardAvailability method the cells that are marked as card.CellType.EMPTY or
card.CellType.HOLE are set in boardAvailability without any cards in boardWithCards ensuring that non
card.CellType.CARD cells are null in the boardWithCards.

These are invariants because they are logical statements that occur consistently throughout
the model that have to be true for the board to work.

Coordinate System:
The game board is represented as a 2D array, where each element corresponds to a cell on the board.
The coordinate system uses a row-major order, meaning that the first index represents the row (y-coordinate),
and the second index represents the column (x-coordinate).

Origin: The origin of the grid is located at the top-left corner, with coordinates (0, 0).
Row and Column Indices:

board[row][col]: Here, row specifies the vertical position (moving downward increases the row index),
and col specifies the horizontal position (moving right increases the column index).

Changes for Part 2
In reexamining the model’s design and implementation from the previous assignment,
we identified a few areas that needed enhancements to improve gameplay functionality and user experience.
Below is a summary of the changes made, explaining what functionality was previously missing, the reasons behind it,
and how we addressed these issues.

1. Move Evaluation: calculateFlips
Missing Functionality: The original model lacked a method for evaluating the potential impact of a move before
executing it. Without a preview option, players couldn’t anticipate how many opponent cards their move might flip,
limiting strategic planning.

New Addition: We introduced calculateFlips, a method that calculates the number of opponent cards that would be flipped
if a player places a card at a specific position.

Implementation Details: The calculateFlips method examines the board in four cardinal directions
(North, South, East, West) using the helper function countFlipsInDirection to tally flips based on game rules.
This change allows players to preview move impacts without altering the board state, supporting more strategic decision-making.

2. Real-Time Score Tracking: getPlayerScore
Missing Functionality: The previous model didn’t offer real-time score tracking. As a result, the player’s score wasn’t
dynamically updated or displayed based on board state changes.

New Addition: We added getPlayerScore, a method that counts a player's cards on the board and returns the current score.

Implementation Details: getPlayerScore iterates over the board, identifying cards associated with the specified player.
This addition enables real-time score updates, enriching the competitive aspect of the game and giving players
immediate feedback on their progress.

3. Separation of File Management
Missing Functionality: File reading functionality was initially embedded within the model, reducing modularity and
compromising the model’s focus on game logic.

New Addition: File reading has been moved outside the model into a dedicated class, allowing the model to concentrate
on game-specific operations.

Implementation Details: By externalizing file reading, the model now better adheres to single-responsibility principles,
improving modularity and readability.

4. Enhanced Turn Management: getPlayerToPlace and getCardIndexToPlace
Missing Functionality: The model previously lacked a method to track a player’s current selection, complicating
the turn-by-turn logic.

New Addition: We added getPlayerToPlace and getCardIndexToPlace to the model interface to manage the current card selection.

Implementation Details: These methods keep track of the player’s intended card placement, streamlining
turn-taking and enhancing game flow consistency.

5. Read-Only Model Interface
Missing Functionality: Previously, the view had access to mutator methods, risking unintended modifications to the model.

New Addition: We created a ReadOnlyModel interface that exposes only observer methods to the view.

Implementation Details: By restricting the view to read-only access, this interface preserves the integrity of the
model state and aligns with MVC architecture best practices.

6. Removing Concrete Class-types From Model Implementation:
To improve flexibility and adherence to interface-based design principles,
we removed concrete class references within the model implementation wherever possible.
Instead of directly using specific class types like PlayerImpl or CardImpl,
we rely on interfaces (IPlayer, ICard)

7. After developing the calculateFlips method to accurately assess potential card flips based on
placement, we were able to implement two distinct strategies tailored to different playstyles:
FlipTheMostStrategy and CornerStrategy. Below is an overview of each strategy, our design approach,
and how they behave on various board setups, such as a 3x1 board.

Handling the 3x1 Board Setup
One interesting scenario was the narrow 3x1 board, where the concept of "corners" is limited
and traditional strategies may need adjustment. On a 3x1 board, the lack of corners and restricted
placements required a fallback approach. For such configurations, we determined that if the board
height or width is 1, our CornerStrategy would ignore corner logic and instead select placements
starting from the uppermost (or leftmost) position, following the upper-leftmost rule as a fallback.

2. FlipTheMostStrategy
The FlipTheMostStrategy prioritizes maximizing card flips, making it an aggressive,
offensive approach. Here’s how we structured and implemented it:

Objective: Place a card where it will flip the maximum number of opponent’s cards.

Approach:
Use calculateFlips to evaluate each empty cell on the board.
For each placement, calculate the number of opponent cards that would flip if a specific card
from the player's hand is placed in that spot.
Select the placement with the highest flip count, which maximizes the impact of each move.
If two placements yield the same number of flips, the strategy defaults to the uppermost-leftmost
position, as a deterministic rule for breaking ties.
This strategy is well-suited for boards with many open spots, as it maximizes control over the
board by flipping the most cards with each turn.

3. CornerStrategy
The CornerStrategy provides a more defensive approach by focusing on corner placements,
aiming to minimize card vulnerability. Here’s the breakdown of how it operates:

Objective: Place cards in corners first, as corner spots are generally harder for
opponents to flip due to limited adjacent directions.

Approach:
Identify the four corners of the board and examine if they are empty and available for placement.
For each available corner, calculate the vulnerability of placing a card there based on its
directional values and neighboring cell types. calculateVulnerability is used to assess exposure,
prioritizing cards with higher directional values for the exposed sides.
Select the card that minimizes vulnerability based on the chosen corner’s specific direction
exposure (e.g., a corner with north and east exposure would prefer cards with higher values
in those directions).If no corners are available, the strategy defaults to selecting the
uppermost-leftmost open position as a fallback. 3x1 Board Specific Handling: On a 3x1 board,
where corner logic is non-applicable, the CornerStrategy bypasses corner placement and instead
seeks the uppermost-leftmost open cell with minimal vulnerability. Each strategy was designed to
balance the game with varied approaches, allowing for both offensive and defensive playstyles.
The implementation of calculateFlips and calculateVulnerability was critical, enabling each
strategy to make informed decisions based on the board state and opponent positioning. These
methods not only determine optimal placements but also enable nuanced, adaptable playstyles
that adjust to different board configurations.

8. We made mock classes for testing purposes. Here’s how we used mocks to test specific aspects
of each strategy: Verifying Full Coverage of Coordinates: For strategies like CornerStrategy and
FlipTheMostStrategy, it was essential to confirm that each strategy evaluated the relevant board
positions. For instance, we wanted to check if CornerStrategy indeed checked all four corners and
if FlipTheMostStrategy evaluated all possible locations. By mocking the model to record every
coordinate accessed during strategy execution, we could verify through this transcript that each
strategy inspected the correct positions. Testing Selection of the Optimal Move: To ensure that
FlipTheMostStrategy picked the most valuable location, we used the mock model to simulate specific
game states, such as “lying” about the legality or value of certain moves. For example, the mock
could make only one move appear valid or assign an artificially high flip count to a specific
location, and we could then check if the strategy selected that pre-determined move. This allowed
us to test the strategy’s decision-making under controlled conditions, verifying that it followed
the intended logic.

Changes for Part 3:

New Interfaces

    IStrategy:
    Defines the contract for implementing AI strategies.
    Includes methods for determining the best move based on the current game state.
    Enables flexible integration of different AI strategies into the game.

    Features:
    Acts as a bridge between the view and the controller.
    Defines user interaction events, such as handling cell and card clicks.
    Improves modularity by abstracting controller interactions.

New Classes

    PlayerFactory:
    Implements the Factory design pattern to dynamically create players.
    Supports both human players and AI players with configurable strategies.
    Simplifies player creation and allows easy addition of new strategies in the future.

    StrategyPlayer:
    Represents an AI player that uses a defined strategy to make decisions during gameplay.
    Integrates with the model through the IStrategy interface.


Modified Classes

    Main:
    Updated to use the PlayerFactory for player creation based on command-line arguments.
    Improved flexibility for initializing games with any combination of human and AI players.
    Validates command-line inputs and initializes players and the game configuration accordingly.

    ModelImpl:
    Added support for notifying observers about player hand updates in real-time.
    Improved turn management to ensure synchronization between the model, view, and controller.

    ViewFrameGUIImpl:
    Added a refreshHands method to dynamically redraw the player's hand based on the current game state.
    Enhanced interactivity by bringing the active player’s window to the foreground during their turn.

    ControllerGUIImpl:
    Adjusted to handle dynamic hand updates using the refreshHands method in the view.
    Improved turn management to ensure proper notifications and interactions for both players.

Design Changes
    Factory Design Pattern:
    Introduced PlayerFactory to centralize and simplify the player creation process.
    Ensures clean separation of concerns by moving player setup logic out of Main.

    Observer Pattern Enhancements
    The controller now observes both the model and the view, ensuring seamless communication
    and real-time synchronization. The model notifies the controller about key game changes,
    such as turn transitions or hand updates. In response, the controller updates the view—enabling
    interactions for human players, refreshing displays, and bringing the active player’s window to
    the front. For AI players, the controller triggers their strategy to compute a move and sends it
    to the model. The controller also handles user inputs from the view, validating actions like card
    selection and forwarding them to the model. These enhancements create a responsive game framework
    where human and AI players interact smoothly, with the model, view, and controller staying in sync.

    GUI Enhancements:
    Player views dynamically update their hand and board displays to reflect the latest game state.
    The active player’s window is brought to the foreground to improve turn-based interactivity.
